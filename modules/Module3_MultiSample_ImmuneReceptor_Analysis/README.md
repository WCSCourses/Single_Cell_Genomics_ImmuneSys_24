### Abstract:

Single cell technologies provide significant opportunities for biological discovery, but the laboratory methods and intrinsic sample variability pose challenges when analyzing samples together. Similarly, the sparse nature of expression data requires special statistical handling when comparing samples across groups. This module present ways to deal with batch effects and variance-reducing methods in downstream analyses of scRNAseq. On the other hand, this module cover the basics of receptor biology and explain how receptor sequences are obtained, both through targeted methods and serendipitous discovery. It will address the challenges involved in interpreting these sequences and explore the various applications of this data. In the practical section, participants will work with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data that contains receptor information. The session will include an introduction to accessing this data and outline the typical benefits it provides.

### Learning objectives:

1. Understand the challenges and importance of integrating single-cell data from multiple samples and explore strategies to mitigate unwanted variability.
2. Identify various integration methods for multi-sample single-cell data and learn how to evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.
3. Perform differential abundance analysis to compare cell type proportions across different samples, accounting for batch effect.
4. Understand the differences between single-cell level and pseudo bulk approaches to perform differential gene expression analysis
5. Run differential gene expression analysis on scRNAseq data using a pseudo-bulk approach
6. Understand the benefits that immune receptor information can bring 
7. Learn how immune receptors can be obtained from scRNA-seq data, how they can influence data interpretation in standard scRNA-seq analyses, and the potential interpretation issues
8. Apply methods learned in previous practical parts to interact with a scRNAseq object that includes immune receptor information
