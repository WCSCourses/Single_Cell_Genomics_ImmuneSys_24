### Abstract:

Single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a modern technology used to study the transcriptome of a cell, providing an exhaustive view of gene expression, which allows to get insights into cellular function. It is the most advanced biotechnological method in the single-cell field, enabling the examination of the entire RNA content within a cell. This tutorial will explain the general characteristics of single-cell data and will offer a computational practice over open data to understand the workflow of scRNA-seq data analysis.

### Learning objectives:

1. To know the fundamentals of single cell and immune system applications
2. Use of R in Google colab notebooks
3. Understand of single-cell data structure in Seurat
4. Implement of scRNA-seq pre-processing and quality control
5. Recognize importance of data normalization
6. Perform dimensionality reduction and clustering
7. Explore automated cell annotation approaches
8. Comprehend utility of differential gene expression, application between clusters
